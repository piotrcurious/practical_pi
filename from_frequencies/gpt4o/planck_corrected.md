If we assume that the Planck length  imposes a fundamental limit on the maximum quadrature (precision) of quantum effects, this effectively quantizes spacetime and imposes discrete limits on measurements. To incorporate these constraints, we must modify some of the equations presented to respect these discrete boundaries.

1. Planck Length and Area Quantization

In a quantized spacetime framework, the area  cannot be continuous but must instead be quantized in multiples of the Planck area:

A_n = 4\pi n l_P^2 \quad \text{(where n is an integer)}.

Thus, the area of a sphere becomes:

A_n = 4\pi n \left(\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}\right).

This quantization modifies the energy density or entropy relations where continuous spacetime assumptions break down.

2. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator with Planck-Scale Quadrature

The ground-state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator, , must now respect Planck-scale constraints. If the maximum precision in position and momentum is bounded by  and  respectively, the oscillator cannot access energy states with sub-Planckian quadrature. Hence, the allowed energies become:

E_n = n \hbar \omega, \quad n \geq 1.

This eliminates the ground-state "half-energy" contribution, consistent with discrete Planck-scale limitations.

3. Path Integral with Discretized Spacetime

In Feynman’s path integral,  appears due to continuous integration over all paths. If spacetime is quantized, the path integral becomes a discrete sum:

K(x, t; x', t') = \sum_{\text{quantized paths}} \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi i \hbar (t - t')}} e^{i S/\hbar}.

The quadrature limit restricts the spatial and temporal resolutions to:

x_n = n l_P, \quad t_n = n t_P \quad \text{(where t_P = l_P / c)}.

This modifies the propagator normalization, with  now interpreted in the context of discrete spacetime cells.

4. Uncertainty Principle and Planck-Scale Limits

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is modified to incorporate a minimum measurable length  and its reciprocal momentum:

\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{\hbar}{4\pi l_P^2}.

This correction arises because , imposing a nonzero minimum uncertainty product. The wavefunctions are then expressed as discrete Fourier series rather than continuous transforms:

\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{p} \phi(p) e^{ipx/\hbar},

5. Black Hole Entropy and Planck Quantization

In the context of black hole entropy, the quantized area  modifies the entropy:

S_n = \frac{k_B c^3 A_n}{4 G \hbar} = n k_B.

This implies that black hole entropy is an integer multiple of , with  manifesting only through the discrete unit .

Conclusion

Introducing the Planck length as a limit on quadrature modifies quantum and relativistic equations to reflect discrete, quantized structures in spacetime. While  still appears due to spherical symmetries and wave dynamics, its role becomes tied to discrete geometries and the Planck-scale constraints. These corrections emphasize the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity at the smallest scales.
