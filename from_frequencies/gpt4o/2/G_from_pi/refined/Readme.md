To refine the "empirical " calculation, we can combine the two methods:

1. Numerical : Calculate  numerically using a high-precision algorithm like Gauss-Legendre.


2. Empirical Constants: Use precise values of Planck length () and Planck energy () to infer , and then use this  to refine  indirectly.



This ensures that empirical measurements and numerical methods are cross-referenced to improve the precision.
